To enable offline invoice PDF generation, download the UMD build of jsPDF (e.g. jspdf.umd.min.js) from the jsPDF releases (https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/releases) and place the file here as "jspdf.umd.min.js".

If the file is present, the app will load it first for invoice PDF downloads and will fall back to the CDN when not available.
